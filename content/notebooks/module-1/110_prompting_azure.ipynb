    "System prompts are the easiest way to modify an agent's performance and persona.  \n",
    "\n",
    "• Role Setting: Using a system prompt can change the agent's behavior (e.g., making it act as a \"science fiction writer\" to answer questions it normally couldn't).  \n",
    "• Few-Shot Prompting: You can provide input-output pair examples within the prompt to force the agent to follow a specific style or length.  \n",
    "• Structural Constraints: Explicitly defining the structure (e.g., asking for four specific topics) prevents the LLM from hitting \"self-determined word counts\" and keeps answers high-quality.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the different techniques in the following examples."
